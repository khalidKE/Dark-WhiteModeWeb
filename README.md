# 🌙 Night Owl - Dark Mode Toggle

**Night Owl** is a simple and elegant web interface that implements a dark mode toggle feature. This project showcases how to switch between light and dark themes using **HTML**, **CSS variables**, and **JavaScript**, ensuring a smooth user experience with persistent theme preference using `localStorage`.

## ✨ Features

- 🌓 **Theme Toggle:** Easily switch between light and dark themes.
- 🎨 **CSS Variables:** Theme colors are handled with CSS custom properties for maintainability.
- 💾 **Persistent Mode:** Selected theme is saved and remembered on page reload.
- 🖋️ **Custom Typography:** Headings use **Roboto Bold (24px)** and body text uses **Arial (16px)**.
- ⚡ **Smooth Transitions:** Transitions between themes are animated for a better UX.

## 🔧 How It Works

### Light Theme
- Background: `#ffffff`
- Text: `#333333`

### Dark Theme
- Background: `#333333`
- Text: `#ffffff`

The toggle button is placed in the top-right corner of the header. When toggled, it switches the `data-theme` attribute on the `body`, allowing CSS to apply the correct theme.
